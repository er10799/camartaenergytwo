# Project Plan — Camarta Energy

## TO DO

- Fix container issue on homepage (Tested at work and it seems fine - need to look into this more)
- Adjust carousel height for hero images
- Add more content to main page (bottom horizontal scrollable pics and reviews?)
- Get idea from choclatier website (scrollable background and bottom scrollable piece as well).
- Map out other pages.

---

## Notes

- Use semantic HTML tags:

  - `header` for top-of-page content like logo or navigation (often includes the Hero)
  - `main` for the main content area
  - `section` for distinct parts of the page, like Services, Projects, About, Contact
  - `footer` for bottom info (copyright, contact info)
  - `article` or `div` inside sections for smaller content blocks if needed

- Good resource for placeholder images:
  - [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/)
  - git log --oneline --graph
