## Which semantic HTML tags to use?

header — for top-of-page content, like logo or navigation (often includes the Hero).
section — for distinct parts of the page, like Services, Projects, About, Contact.
main — for the main content area.
footer — for the bottom info (copyright, contact info, etc.).
article or div inside sections, if needed, for smaller content pieces.
